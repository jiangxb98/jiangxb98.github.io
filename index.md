## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I have been since 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Gang Wang and Prof. [Jun Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1eW5CFkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Additionally, I have interned at COWAROBOT, AMD, and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

## Research Interests
